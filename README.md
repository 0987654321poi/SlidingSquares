# SlidingSquares

Part 2 of my CSCI 201 final skills video. Here I made a p5js program that has a text box saying "my first p5js!". It also has red squares which slide back and forth
across the screen in time with the music. I thought my project looked kind of cool because of how the motion syncs with the audio, I thought it made the project kind
of tranquil looking.
